I posted thoughts on <a href="http://benbrostoff.github.io/2014/12/28/Resolution/" target="_blank"> improving as a programmer </a> in 2015 a few days back, but thought I would post my complete resolutions so I can reference them come 12/31/2015. <a href="http://blog.fogus.me/" target="_blank">Fogus</a> has an awesome tradition on his blog of posting "The best things and stuff of [Year]" going back to 2010, so I think it would be cool to emulate that idea with resolutions and reflections on whether those resolutions were met or not. Here we go, by type: 

**Attitude**

1. Keep this quote in mind every day. From Marcus Aurelius in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255" target="_blank">Meditations</a>, Book 2.5:

<blockquote>
Concentrate every minute... on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can - if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and relevant life?
</blockquote>

**Craft**

1. Program every day
2. Blog every month with a quality post
3. Read cover to cover <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computation-Machines-Impossible-Programs/dp/1449329276" target="_blank">Understanding Computation</a>
4. Study Haskell and Lisp in concert on weekends, under the theory that <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/12/30/how-to-learn-efficiently/" target="_blank">interleaved study trumps mass study</a>
5. Review <a href="https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish" target="_blank">Sunfish</a> in its entirety and blog on it

**Fitness (Body and Mind)**

1. Eradicate sugar intake, sans social occassions 
2. 20 minutes+ of physical activity, 5+ days a week
3. Meditate 5+ minutes every day  
4. Read 20+ minutes every day

**Other**

1. Memorize a 52 card deck in < 5 minutes
2. Complete the Rubik's cube in < 5 minutes
