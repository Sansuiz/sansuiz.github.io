A couple of my favorite things: the documentary <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/meru_2015/" target="_blank">Meru</a>, the essay <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/21/in-deep-2" target="_blank">In Deep</a>, the 30 for 30s on <a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=into-the-wind" target="_blank">Terry Fox</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=the-birth-of-big-air" target="_blank">Dave Mirra</a>. In all of them, there are people who in the truest sense of the words are *willing to risk life and limb for their craft*.

That is exceedingly rare in a world where we have all the things we need and more.
