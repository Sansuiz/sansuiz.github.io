I am a software engineer at [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) (we're hiring!). On the side, I consult on a few projects and have experience in the healthcare, consumer and data-analytics spaces. I have worked on behalf of some of the top Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) players in the world and am the author of [DraftFast](https://github.com/BenBrostoff/draftfast), GitHub's most starred open-source DFS optimization library.

Professionally, I mostly work in Python and JavaScript (server and client-side). I care deeply about improving as a programmer and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new.

I have experience consulting on a range of projects and am available for your project of choice on a part-time basis. Also, I like to read and am always looking for [book recommendations](/books). Shoot me an e-mail any time at <a href="mailto:ben.brostoff@gmail.com"> ben.brostoff [at] gmail [dot] com </a> if you're interested in either.
